# JavaScript

## TODO

- Events
- Array functions
- objects

## Variables and constants

- var is no longer used, but you might found some in older libraries.
- difference between hard-coded constants and runtime constants

### Naming

- case-sensitive
- camelCase

## Operators

- the comma operator:
    - evaluate multiple expressions but return only the last one

## Strings

- Using backsticks you can declare a string using templates `${variable}` (like kotlin).
- Backsticks also allow multiline.

## Functions

- default parameters and optional.
- anonymous functions and arrow functions
- function expressions and declarations - scope
- js call-stack:
    - whenever a function is called, the engine creates a function execution 
      context, pushes it to the top of the stack and start executing it.

## Arrays

- The difference between an array and an object is that the array uses a numbered 
  index rather than a named index.

## objects
