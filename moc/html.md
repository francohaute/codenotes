## Head

Important information.

NEVER USE ANY ELEMENT THAT DISPLAY CONTENT

The head is very important for accessibility

## Text 

The `<strong>` and `<em>` element are important because it marks the text as
important for screen readers

## Links

`_blank`: opens the link on a new tab
`noopener`: prevents the opened link to gain access to the page from wich it open
`noreferrer`: prevents the opened link from knowing wich page or resource has a link
to it the noreferrer comes with the noopener in it.
