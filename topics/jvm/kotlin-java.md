# Kotlin and java interoperability

## Interfaces

### Kotlin interfaces with defaults method implementation

You can call java default implementation from kotlin without issue.

But to call a kotlin default implementation from java code you will need to call 
the static method generated by kotlin.

## Functions
### Calling kotlin functions from java code

#### Functions declared outside a class

The compiler grabs any kotlin function outside of a class and create a class for 
it with the name of the file where the function was declared (capitalize to match 
java naming scheme) and sufixed with "Kt". In case you want to change the name
of the generated class you have to add "@file:JvmName("NewName")" at the beggining
of the file where the kotlin function was declared.

#### Default values

In case you want to call a kotlin function from java code, you have to pass every
default value in the java code or annotate the kotlin function with @JvmOverloads
wich will create java overloaded methods omitting each of the parameters one by 
one starting from the last. Each overload uses the default value in the parameters
omitted by the signature.
