# Packages in kotlin

Every kotlin file can have a package declaration at the beginning.

Declarations defined in other files can be used if they are in the same package,
else you need to import them.

Unlike java, in kotlin you don't have to put every file of a package in a folder
with the same name as the package, but it is recommended for best practices since
you would possibly end up working with java code. Also unlike java you can declare
multiple classes in a single file and also the file doesn't need to have the same 
name as the class.
